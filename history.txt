HISTORY PHOTOGRAPHY

-The roots of photography extend back further than you might assume. In the 4th 
Century BC, Aristotle made use of the principles of the camera obscura, in 
which an image is projected through a small hole. Through a camera obscura’s 
pinhole, the image of the world is often reversed or upside-down. While our 
notion of a camera has evolved dramatically, the “camera obscura” is 
considered the ancient building block upon which further revolutionary 
developments and inventions in the field of photography were built.

WHO INVENTED PHOTOGRAPHY?

Joseph Nicéphore Niépce and Louis Daguerre are often considered the inventors 
of photography with cameras as we now know it. The former started out 
experimenting with silver chloride and silver halide photography, but couldn’t
figure out how to prevent them from darkening with exposure to light.

In 1826, Niépce succeeded in taking the first camera photograph. He used a 
sheet of pewter coated with bitumen, which required an exposure time of at 
least 8 hours! The subject of this photograph hit close to home for Niépce; 
it is the view from his workroom in Saint-Loup-de-Varennes, France.
Painter Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre was so excited by this achievement, 
he partnered with Niépce. Daguerre continued to develop, refine, and tinker 
with the process using silver-plated sheets of copper and fuming them with 
mercury vapor. As he continued to develop this process, Daguerre was able to 
vastly reduce to the exposure time.

In 1839, with exposure times of just a few seconds, the daguerreotype first 
became a means of using photography commercially for portraits. This has 
proven to be a critical juncture in the history of photograph when it comes 
to the proliferation of cameras and the success of the medium.
Just a few years later, William Henry Fox Talbot came up with the calotype 
process. This was the first process that let photographers create a negative 
from which multiple prints could be made.

In 1851, Frederick Scott Archer introduced the collodion wet plate process, 
which produced a negative image on a transparent glass plate. Although it was 
surpassed by the gelatin dry plate process in the late 1800s, the collodion 
process was used for tintype portraits and in the printing industry well into 
the 1900s.

DIGITALIZATION AND IMAGE EDITING IN THE PHOTOGRAPHY HISTORY

With the digital revolution at the end of the 20th century, once again, the 
world experienced photography in a new light. Photos no longer needed to be 
produced on analog mediums, but could be saved and edited digitally instead. 
This simplified the editing process tremendously.

This digitalization also brought unimaginable possibilities in photographic 
post-processing. Artists put the technology to the widest variety of creative 
uses. Pep Ventosa, for example, digitally layers countless individual images. 
Sabine Wild does intricate line-based editing, and Isabelle Menin uses 
computers to assemble photographs into floral compositions. All three are 
evidence of the medium’s sheer boundless potential.
