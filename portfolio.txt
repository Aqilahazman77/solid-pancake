Portfolio
Hello, my name is Aqilah Azman. I am an uitm kedah branch student studying in computer science and maths.
Photography is my creative outlet: expressive, transformative and meaningful. My practice is highly versatile, with professional experience in a wide range of styles and genres. Comfortable in studio and on location, I love to explore the unlimited potential of light. I also adore working with people, building relationships and capturing memorable moments.
